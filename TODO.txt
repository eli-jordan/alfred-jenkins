* Drill into build history
   - Currently the workflow can only display jobs. Its not possible to drill into a particular job and
     see the build history.

* Favorites
   - Allow adding certain jobs to favorites, so they can be located quickly

* Fuzzy search
   - The built-in fuzzy search in Alfred is not very good.
   - See if its feasible to use a custom fuzzy search implementation to make this better

* Build and release process, including adding the info.plist to source control.
   - Probably create an sbt plugin
