* (done) Drill into build history
   - Currently the workflow can only display jobs. Its not possible to drill into a particular job and
     see the build history.


* Fix icon paths
   - Currently the icon paths are hard coded to suit my system

* Build and release process, including adding the info.plist to source control.
   - Probably create an sbt plugin
   - SVG -> PNG

* Error handling and validation

-----------

* Favorites
   - Allow adding certain jobs to favorites, so they can be located quickly

* Fuzzy search
   - The built-in fuzzy search in Alfred is not very good.
   - See if its feasible to use a custom fuzzy search implementation to make this better



* Extract the common components into a library that can be reused to create new alfred workflows
